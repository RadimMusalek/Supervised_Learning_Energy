Project description

## ChatGPT prompting and responses

### Initial prompt:
Would you have any suggestions for a machine learning project for my portfolio to showcase my skills? It should be an MVP, not a production level, and relevant for the energy industry. Preferable somehow related to solar and photovoltaics.

### Response:
Solar and photovoltaics projects that would make a great MVP for your portfolio:

#### Solar Power Generation Forecasting
Use weather data (temperature, sunlight hours, cloud cover, etc.) and historical solar power generation data to predict future power output.
Techniques: Time series forecasting (e.g., LSTM, ARIMA, XGBoost).
Data Sources: OpenWeatherMap API, PVOutput.org, local energy providers.

#### Solar Panel Fault Detection
Develop a model that detects anomalies in solar panel performance using sensor data (voltage, current, temperature).
Techniques: Anomaly detection (Isolation Forest, Autoencoders, Statistical methods).
Data Sources: Public datasets or simulated data based on normal and faulty conditions.

#### Optimal Solar Panel Placement Using Satellite Imagery
Use satellite/aerial images to classify areas based on suitability for solar panel installation (e.g., rooftops vs. shaded areas).
Techniques: Computer Vision (CNNs, Semantic Segmentation).
Data Sources: Google Earth Engine, OpenStreetMap, PVGIS.

#### Energy Consumption vs. Solar Generation Analysis
Analyze the correlation between household/business energy consumption patterns and solar power generation to optimize battery storage usage.
Techniques: Clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN), Predictive Modeling.
Data Sources: Energy consumption datasets, PVOutput.org.

#### Dynamic Solar Pricing Model
Predict electricity prices based on solar generation forecasts and demand trends.
Techniques: Regression models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
Data Sources: Market price data from energy exchanges.

# Switzerland PV off-grid solution project

## Initial prompt:
Would you have any recommendations how to approach a project which would compare optimal solar panel placement residential areas of Switzerland with the complication to deliver electricity from the grid? I.e. finding areas in Switzerland suitable for off-grid energy solutions where a solar combined with batteries might be an effective option.

## Response by ChatGPT:
Thatâ€™s a great project idea! Here's a structured approach to tackling it:

### **1. Define the Problem Statement**  
- Identify areas in Switzerland where off-grid solar-plus-battery solutions might be viable based on:  
  - **Solar potential** (sunlight availability, shading, orientation).  
  - **Grid accessibility issues** (distance from grid infrastructure, cost of extension).  
  - **Energy consumption patterns** (typical household demand).  
  - **Economic feasibility** (cost of batteries vs. grid expansion).  

### **2. Collect & Prepare Data**  
#### **Solar Potential Data**  
- **Source:** PVGIS (Photovoltaic Geographical Information System) provides solar radiation maps for Europe.  
- **Features:** Solar irradiance, tilt angles, shading.  

#### **Grid Accessibility Data**  
- **Source:** Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE) or OpenStreetMap for power grid infrastructure.  
- **Features:** Distance to nearest power lines, transformer station availability.  

#### **Energy Demand Data**  
- **Source:** Swiss statistical data on residential electricity consumption.  
- **Features:** Household size, consumption trends, seasonal variations.  

#### **Geospatial Data**  
- **Source:** OpenStreetMap, Swiss GeoPortal.  
- **Features:** Terrain elevation, urban vs. rural classification, building density.  

### **3. Feature Engineering**  
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Use GIS tools (QGIS, Google Earth Engine) to map out high-potential solar areas.  
- **Clustering**: Identify remote or sparsely populated areas where grid extension is expensive.  
- **Energy Needs vs. Supply Match**: Compare solar potential with energy consumption in identified regions.  

### **4. Model Selection**  
- **Solar Suitability Prediction**: Train a classification model (Random Forest, CNN with satellite images) to label areas as "high" or "low" solar potential.  
- **Grid Accessibility Scoring**: Use clustering algorithms (K-Means, DBSCAN) to classify regions by distance to grid.  
- **Economic Feasibility Model**: Apply regression models to estimate costs of grid expansion vs. battery-based storage solutions.  

### **5. Visualization & Insights**  
- Use **Folium or Plotly** for interactive maps.  
- Present case studies of areas with the highest off-grid potential.  

### **6. Validation & MVP Deployment**  
- Compare model recommendations with known off-grid solar installations in Switzerland.  
- Create a simple **web dashboard** (Streamlit, Dash) to visualize results.

## Sources
There have been several studies and projects focusing on off-grid photovoltaic (PV) solutions in Switzerland and Europe. Here are some notable examples:

### **1. AlpinSolar Project**

The AlpinSolar project, completed in 2022, installed nearly 5,000 solar panels on Switzerland's Lake Muttsee dam. This high-altitude installation leverages increased sunlight and snow reflection to maximize energy production, especially during winter months. Managed by Axpo, it generates approximately 3.3 million kilowatt-hours annually, sufficient to power 700 households. This project exemplifies innovative approaches to solar energy generation in challenging environments.

### **2. Economic Viability Study by ETH Zurich and University of Bern**

In February 2023, researchers from ETH Zurich and the University of Bern conducted a study assessing the economic viability of solar panel installations across 2,067 Swiss municipalities. The study concluded that solar installations are financially viable for nearly half of single-family homes with gas heating, assuming a profitability threshold exceeding 3% over a 30-year period. Factors considered included installation and maintenance costs, system performance, tax rates, and compensation rates for energy fed back into the grid.

### **3. Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (Fraunhofer ISE)**

The Fraunhofer ISE in Germany is a leading research institution dedicated to solar energy. Their work encompasses a broad spectrum of solar technologies, including off-grid power supplies. They develop renewable energy systems tailored for remote rural areas, telecommunications, environmental monitoring, and portable electronic devices, aiming to provide autonomous power solutions independent of the grid.
